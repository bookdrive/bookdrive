<h1>The Mission</h1>

<p>In the United States, literacy is a prerequisite for accessing meaningful opportunities.  Conversely, the lack of literacy skills can have disastrous consequences.  A study found that &ldquo;The educational careers of 25 to 40 percent of American children are imperiled because they donâ€™t read well enough, quickly enough, or easily enough.&rdquo;  The mission of the Richmond Book Drive is to put compelling, relevant books into the hands of young people in middle and high schools throughout the City of Richmond, California.  We aim to provide students &mdash; be they reluctant or voracious readers &mdash; with books that they will love, book that will turn them into lifelong readers and learners. In the process, we hope to spread the message that all students are worthy of investment, that none are beyond repair, and that ours is a city full of curiosity and hope.<p/>
